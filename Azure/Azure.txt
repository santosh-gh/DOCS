Infrastructure Setup
====================
Server
Storage
Developers
Dedicated Network
Application Security

- Need huge Capital
- Tedious Process (Setup, Power Backup, Disaster Recovery)


Deployement Model
------------------
- Private Cloud
- Public Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud



What Can we do in Azure Cloud

- Create Applications and Services
- Use Storage
- Host Applications
- Analytics

Azure Services
 -Compute (VMs, Cloud Service, Functions, Service Fabric)
 -Networking (VNet, SubNet, VNet Gateway, Subnet Gateway,CDN, DNS, NSG, Firewall, P2SVPN, S2SVPN, ExpressRoute)
 -Storage (Blob, Table, Queue, File)


Application Cycle

- Build
- Deploy
- Management

Hosting Requirement
Machines (Hard Disk,RAM,CPU)
SWs(Libaries, Tools)
Network (Band Width, FireWall, Router)

On Premises Management (Responsible for everything, Pay Advance)
  - Application
  - Data
  - OS
  - Server
  - Storage
  - Networking


Man Power For
 - Setting up the Web and Database Servers(Procurment, Installation)
 - Networking
 - Regular Backup
 - Disaster Recovery
 - Monitor and Management
 

Azure Service Model
===================

 - Infracture -IAAS(Own a CAR)
   - VMs (RAM, CPU), Network
   - We Manage (Application, Data, OS, Rumtime, Middleware, Virtualization)
   - Azure Manage (Server, Storage, Physicsl Network)
   
   -VM, Container, Service Fabric

 - Platform - PAAS(Rent A CAR)
   - OS, Web Server (IIS, Tomcat, Apachee), Database, 
   - We Manage (Application, Data)
   - Azure Manage (OS, Server, Storage, Physicsl Network, Rumtime, Middleware, Virtualization)

   - App service(Web App, API App, Logic App, Mobile App), Functions, PowerApps
    
 - Software - SAAS(Use OLA, UBER)
   - Software tools, MS Office, Send Grid, Twillio

Cloud follows 2 Principles
On Demand(Fleible,elastic, Pay for what you use)
Out Sourced(Backup, Installation, Lisience)

How does Azure Work?
1. Uses Virtuallization
2. Virtulization separates the tight coupling between the CPU an OS by using a Abstract Layer called Hypervisor
3. Hypervsor emulates all the features of a real computer machine. It can run multiple VMs at the same time.
4. It can run any compatible OS such as Windows or Linux
5. Each Data center there are many Racks filled with Servers
6. Each Server contains Hypervisor to run multiple VMs
7. Network Switch provide connectivity to the VMs
8. Each Server contains a special piece of software called Fabric Controller
9. Each Fabric controller connected with another piece of software called Orchestrator
10. Orchestrator Manages everything that happens in the Azure including responding user request.
11. User Request to Azure using Orchestrator WEB API
12. When User Request for a VM the Orchestartor package everything that required and send to the best available Rack.
13. The Fabric Controller Create the VM and the user can connect it.

12. WEB API can be called by using many tools (Azure Portal, Power Shell, Azure CLI)
