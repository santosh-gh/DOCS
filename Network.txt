Private Link

1. Private connectivity to services on Azure—traffic remains on the Microsoft network, with no public internet access
2. Integration with on-premises and peered networks
3. Protection against data exfiltration for Azure resources
4. Services delivered directly to your customers’ virtual networks
5. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Private Link keeps traffic on the Microsoft global network.
