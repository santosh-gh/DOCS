You can move an app to another App Service plan, as long as the source plan and the target plan are in the same resource group and geographical region.

The region in which your app runs is the region of the App Service plan it's in. However, you cannot change an App Service plan's region.

If you want to run your app in a different region, one alternative is app cloning. Cloning makes a copy of your app in a new or existing App Service plan in any region.
