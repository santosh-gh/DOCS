Azure File Sync 

AFS centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world.

Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1. The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure file share.

Step 2: Register Server1. Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service. Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.

Step 3: Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint. A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud , which represents an Azure file share and one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.
